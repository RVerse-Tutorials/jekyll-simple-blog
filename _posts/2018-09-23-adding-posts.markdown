Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory.

Edit and upload to your host (say GitHub) to see your changes. You can rebuild the site locally if you have Jekyll installed by running `jekyll serve`. This launches a web server and updates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the yaml (the part between the `---` fences).
